# Individual_Frontend_PIP_Project_7
App Name: #StressReliever


Problem: Life can be very stressful, so people need a way to relieve stress and take their mind off their problems. 

Solution: My app retrieves a database of jokes from an API to give the user a random joke to cheer up their day. 

API Link: `https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/${chosenCategory}?safe-mode`

Feature 1: 
Fetches a joke from the API
Feature 2:
Gives user a dropdown for input to choose a category of jokes they want to hear
Feature 3:
Rating Database: Allows users to rate jokes on a scale of 1-5, providing information about which jokes the users like the best to promote best jokes in the future.

AI Assistance

I used ChatGPT for help on this project:

1. ChatGPT gave me the format of the User Interface and how to line up the contents of the display.
2. I modified it by adding the dropdown menu and rating options to make for a better user experience
3. It enhanced user experience

Future Improvements: 

If I had more time, I would have attempted to find a way to enhance the rating system and create a database for how users liked each joke to improve the quality of the product.
